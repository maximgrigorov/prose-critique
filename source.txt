The old man sat on the porch, watching the sun set over the hills. He had seen many sunsets in his long life, but this one felt different somehow. There was a quality to the light that he couldn't quite describe, a warmth that seemed to reach inside him and stir something long forgotten.

His granddaughter came out with two cups of tea. She was young, barely twenty, with her whole life stretching out before her like an unwritten book. She handed him a cup and sat down beside him without saying a word.

They sat in comfortable silence for a while. He thought about all the things he wanted to tell her — about the mistakes he'd made, the lessons he'd learned, the people he'd lost along the way. But he couldn't find the right words. They seemed inadequate somehow, too small to contain the enormity of what he felt.

"Grandpa," she said finally, "do you ever regret anything?"

He took a sip of his tea and considered the question carefully. It was the kind of question that deserved an honest answer, not some platitude about having no regrets. The truth was more complicated than that.

"I regret the things I didn't do more than the things I did," he said at last. "The conversations I never had. The trips I never took. The risks I was too afraid to take."

She nodded, as if she understood, though he knew she couldn't really. Not yet. Understanding came with time, with living through enough seasons to see the patterns in things.

The sun dipped below the horizon, leaving behind a sky painted in shades of orange and purple. Somewhere in the distance, a dog barked. The world was settling into evening, the way it had done for millions of years before them and would continue to do long after they were gone.

"I think I understand," she said quietly.

He smiled and reached over to pat her hand. "You will," he said. "Give it time."
